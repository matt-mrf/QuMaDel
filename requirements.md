# Requirements

## Processing power
This project executes heuristic solutions to big problems. Any modern processor should be able to run all these programs, where some will take longer than others. We can't give an estimation on an average time it takes to solve these problems.

## Python
For this project, python 3.x was used. To install python 3.x, visit [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Instructions for installing python are all specified here.

## Networkx

After python is installed, you will need networkx 2.x to visualize the graph's the program outputs.

To install networkx run the code below in your terminal to install networkx.

```
$ pip install networkx
```

```
$ pip install --upgrade networkx
```
If this does not directly work, take a look at the following link to see how to install it specifically: [click here](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html)

## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is used to generate the line chart of the costs computed during hill climber algorithms.

To install matplotlib run the following code in your terminal. Make sure you use the correct python version when running.

```
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
```
If this does not directly work, take a look at the following link to see how to install it specifically: [click here](https://matplotlib.org/3.0.2/users/installing.html)
