create graph

set amount of colors

find nodes with degree < amount of colors

if found, remove, and put in stack.
if not, pick node arbitrarily, (maybe with lowest degree?)

now color nodes in stack order. Stack: Last In First Out
  find color that's not used in adjecent nodes
  // when a node is about to be colored that initially had degree > amount of colors
  // there's no guarantee it can be colored in, try anyway, or leave uncolored
if at the end there are nodes with no color, color them with an extra color.
