## Case
Our case is RadioRussia, to be found at http://heuristieken.nl/wiki/index.php?title=Radio_Russia
In this case we are given a problem, to solve via heuristics.

The problem is as following:
Four  different countries: USA, Russia, Ukraine and China all are divided in states/provinces. All these states/provinces need radiotransmitters. The problem we face is that no neighbouring states/provinces can have the same type of transmitter.
